## Comet

[Comet](https://github.com/dotnet/comet) is an simple, C# framework for building [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui) apps that run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows. 

## Maui.Markup

.NET MAUI traditionally favors writing UI in XAML, and XML based markup language that provides separation between UI and logic. By using the .NET MAUI Community Toolkit's [Maui.Markup](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui.Markup) helpers, we can remove the complexity of XAML and stick with C# alone.
